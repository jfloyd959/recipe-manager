# Implementation Examples & Validation Guide

## Example 1: T1 Resource Extractor (Copper Ore)

### Current Broken System:
```
copper-ore-extractor-t1: Copper + MULTI_Power Source + Copper Wire
copper-ore-extractor-t2: Aluminum + MULTI_Power Source + Copper + Copper Wire  
copper-ore-extractor-t3: Aluminum + Copper Wire + Copper + Power Source + Iron
copper-ore-extractor-t4: Aluminum + Copper Wire + Copper + Power Source + Iron + Tin
copper-ore-extractor-t5: Aluminum + Copper Wire + Copper + Power Source + Iron + Tin
```
**Problems**: T4-T5 identical, uses T2 components for T1 resource, no native compliance

## Validation Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Native Building Capability
```
FOR EACH T1-T3 building on EACH valid planet:
1. Identify all required components
2. Verify each component is either:
   a) Naturally available on that planet type, OR
   b) Has a planet-specific alternate available on that planet type
3. Verify all alternate component creation recipes use only planet-native resources
4. PASS: Building can be constructed using only planet resources
5. FAIL: Building requires imported components
```

### Test Case 2: Tier Progression Logic
```
FOR EACH extractor type:
1. Identify the tier of resource being extracted
2. FOR EACH building tier T1-T5:
   a) Verify component tiers match expected ranges for that resource tier
   b) Verify component count matches tier (3,4,5,6,7-8)
   c) Verify construction time follows scaling formula
3. PASS: All building tiers use appropriate component tiers  
4. FAIL: Component tiers don't match extracted resource tier guidelines
```

### Test Case 3: Recipe Uniqueness
```  
FOR EACH extractor type:
1. Compare recipes across all building tiers T1-T5
2. PASS: All 5 recipes are unique (no identical ingredient lists)
3. FAIL: Any duplicate recipes found
```

### Test Case 4: Economic Balance
```
FOR EACH component tier T1-T5:
1. Count usage frequency across all appropriate-tier recipes  
2. PASS: T3-T5 components used in >50% of appropriate recipes
3. FAIL: T3-T5 components remain under-utilized
```

## Expected Output Volume Summary

### Alternate Components by Category:
```
T1 Alternates: ~70-80 components (most needed for native T1-T3 building)
T2 Alternates: ~40-50 components (fill gaps in T2-T3 native building)
T3 Alternates: ~10-15 components (limited gaps, mostly planet-specific variants)
T4+ Alternates: ~5-10 components (minimal need, T4-T5 buildings allow imports)

TOTAL: 125-155 new alternate components
```

### Recipe Updates:
```
Building Recipes: 430 updated (86 extractors Ã— 5 tiers)
Component Recipes: 125-155 new component creation recipes
Total Recipe Changes: 555-585 recipes
```

### Development Validation:
```
Manual Spot-Check Required: ~20-30 extractor progressions
Automated Validation: All 430 building recipes + all component recipes
Economic Balance Testing: Full system playtesting recommended
Performance Impact: Monitor recipe lookup/generation performance
```

This comprehensive system will create meaningful tier progression while enabling native building capability that reduces early-game trade dependency without eliminating late-game logistics complexity.

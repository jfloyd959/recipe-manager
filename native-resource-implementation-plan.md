# 🌟 NATIVE RESOURCE SELF-SUFFICIENCY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Objective**: Enable T1-T3 building construction using primarily native planet resources, eliminating complex multi-planet dependencies for basic claim stake operations.

**Current Problem**: Buildings require crafted materials from multiple planets, creating expensive logistics chains for basic operations.

**Solution**: Create planet-specific alternatives for all building materials, plus native-only hub recipes for bootstrapping.

## 🏗️ DEPENDENCY CHAIN DESIGN

### Building Dependency Flow
```
Claim Stake 
  ↓
Central Hub T1 (comes with stake)
  ↓
Raw Resource Extraction (native T1 resources)
  ↓
Extraction Hub T1 (built with native resources)

## 🎮 GAMEPLAY IMPACT

### Positive Changes
✅ **Simplified Logistics**: No complex multi-planet supply chains for basic operations  
✅ **Faster Expansion**: Establish new claims without extensive preparation  
✅ **Strategic Diversity**: Each planet type has unique material characteristics  
✅ **Self-Sufficiency**: T1-T3 buildings buildable on any planet type  
✅ **Reduced Barriers**: Lower entry requirements for new claim stakes  

### Preserved Complexity
🎯 **T4+ Buildings**: Still require rare/exotic materials from specific planets  
🎯 **Advanced Ships**: Still need specialized multi-planet components  
🎯 **End-Game Content**: Quantum/exotic materials remain challenging  
🎯 **Trade Value**: Higher-tier materials still drive inter-planet commerce  

### Balance Considerations
⚖️ **Material Variety**: 46 base materials × 8 planets = 368 alternatives  
⚖️ **Recipe Complexity**: Native recipes use 2-3 T1 ingredients max  
⚖️ **Performance Scaling**: Native alternatives may have slight stat differences  
⚖️ **Discovery Curve**: Players learn planet-specific material advantages

const selectBuildingMaterials = (building, planetType) => {
  const requiredMaterials = building.requiredMaterials;
  const selectedMaterials = [];
  
  requiredMaterials.forEach(material => {
    // Check for native alternative first
